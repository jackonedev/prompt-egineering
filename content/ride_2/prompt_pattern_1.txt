Patterns in our prompts can tap into
powerful behavior within the large language model. It's trained on all these
different patterns. And it gets really good at using
the patterns in our language and our prompt to decide
what it's going to do. So one of the important things that we're
going to learn about is the concept of a prompt pattern. A pattern for structuring the words and
the statements in your prompt. So what is a prompt pattern? A prompt pattern is a way that we document
a certain structure of phrases and statements in order to solve a particular
problem in with a large language model. So we'd like to interact with
a large language model and we'd like to solve a particular problem. And so a prompt pattern is basically
a way of structuring our statements, a pattern for structuring our statements
to use the large language model to solve that particular problem. So what would be an example of this? Well, let's imagine that
we wanted to consistently generate the words lamb,
its fleece was as white as snow. Well, a pattern could be
any time you need lamb, it's fleece was white as snow you can
write the statement Mary had a little, you will very consistently get lamb, it's
fleece was as white as snow as the output. And so for example, we can go and
we can rerun this lamb, it's fleece was as white as snow. We get more or less behavior. But if we want to consistently
get those next words generated, we can do it over and over and
over again through Mary had a little, it gives us some control over the output. It gives us a consistent
somewhat behavior. Now it's not perfectly consistent,
there's variations in the output. And we've seen in all of these examples,
we've got variation in what happened, but we did get some consistency
in the behavior. So what a prompt pattern is,
it's a way for us to document and talk about certain structures of our
language, series of statements and wording that then will help us
solve some particular problem. If the problem that we need to solve is we
need to get lamb it's fleece as white as snow as the next several
words that are produced. Then this is the pattern we use. Now in many cases,
we might have specific words we want. For example, we may want the large
language model to tell us yes or no. We may want it to summarize something,
we may want it to ask us questions. We may want it to always include
certain things in its output. All of these things are problems
that you might want to solve. We might want to know how do we make
sure it always includes these things and its output? How do we make sure that its output is
always formatted in a particular way? How do we try to make sure or get more consistent behavior
on only getting a yes or a no. These are types of problems that you might
want to solve by changing the pattern of our prompt basically
the structure of our prompt. Now going back to our intuitive
sort of understanding of prompts, you can see why thinking about it in terms
of power patterns is powerful because patterns are basically that are in
our prompt are tapping into things that the large language
model has been trained on. It's been trained to predict
the next word over and over and it's learned certain
patterns from the words. And if we can format our prompt in
a way that taps into those patterns that's learned, we're more likely
to get the behavior we want and solve that particular problem. So we document the pattern and the structure of our prompt in order to
solve a particular problem that we need or generate a particular behavior that
we need for the large language model. So we're going to go through in a series
of lectures throughout this course of specific prompt patterns that
we can use within the context of large language models to
solve important problems.
