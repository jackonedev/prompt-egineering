Prompts allow you to do more than
just ask questions to ChatGPT or tell it to do things,
you can actually write programs. Now, if you're not a programmer, don't worry because everybody can
actually program using ChatGPT. And I don't just mean in writing a bunch
of software that you're going to run on your computer, but actually giving
ChatGPT rules to follow complex instructions that you want it to listen
to and use to generate the output. Now, I'm going to give you
some examples of this. Hopefully give you some intuition
on what I mean by programming and help you to think about how
you can write better props. Now, one way to think about this is
I'm going to talk about it in terms of programming, but you can also think about
it in terms of rules that you would give some type of personal assistant. So let's take a look at an example here. So I'm going to ask ChatGPT
whenever you generate output, turn it into a comma separated value list. Now this is just something
that you might want to do. You want to format your data. So if you've ever worked in Excel comma
separated values are basically a list of items separated by commas. It's a really simple concept. Now, sometimes you can think of tables
as having a comma separated value list, you can think of the first column
in the table is the first value. Then you have a comma for
that differentiates and separates the second column and then
another column is separated with a comma. So you can basically have like a three
column table, you can have the first value and then a comma and then the second value
and then a comma and then a third value. And if you've ever worked with
different spreadsheet programs, you've probably done this. So now GhatGPT says, sure I can do that,
I can output my format. So I'm going to write in
my name is Jules White and I am teaching a course
on prompt engineering. And so what we can see is it creates
a commerce separated value list. We're essentially creating a table,
there are two columns, name and course. And it decides that the first
column is going to be name. It's going to be me and then the second
column is going to be prompt engineering, which is my course. Now notice it decided,
which is kind of interesting, it decided what the columns were
going to be, I didn't tell it. But if I went to go back,
I could maybe give it some more instructions I could say,
from now on the columns of the comma separated value and
comma separated value is CSV. And then in the future examples, I'm
going to start abbreviating this CSV, but I'm writing it out for now. The columns of the comma separated
value list should be name and I'm going to go ahead and
capitalize these to provide some emphasis,
NAME, COURSE and ROLE. So what is the role of
the person in the course? And now I'm going to say again,
my name is Jules White and I am teaching a course
on prompt engineering. And so now we see it, it's reformatted. It's now got NAME, Jules White, COURSE,
Prompt Engineering and ROLE teacher. And so we've actually written
a program if you think about it, what we've told GhatGPT to do is every
time we actually write something, ChatGPT needs to format it in a particular
structure that we've given it. We've wrote a program
that tells it what to do. So it's more than just asking a question. We're actually telling it
how to interpret our input. Now, we could go and
write more for our program, for example, we could say in
addition to whatever I type in, generate additional examples
that fit the format of the CSV that I have
asked you to produce. And so now what we see is it's gone and
it's taken my original format NAME, COURSE and ROLE and
it's now filled out additional examples. And I could say something like my name is Jules White and I am teaching a course on prompt engineering. And you notice now our program
has gotten more complex. Not only is it creating a CSV
based on what I typed in, but it's also following my instructions
and it's going through and generating additional
examples that fit into this. So when you're creating prompts, you can
do much more than just asking a question and get an answer,
you can actually program the interactions. Now, the key to this is that
we're having a conversation. And if you look back at the very
beginning, I provided it the initial sort of instructions which whenever you
generate output, turn it into a comma separated value list and it started doing
that and then I began refining my program. I then say from now on at this point,
I'm adding something to it. I want the columns of the comma separated
value list to be NAME, COURSE and ROLE and then it does that. And then I say now in addition to that,
I want you to generate examples and it does that. And so we've actually written a program
and now whenever we go in and type in new input, so again,
you notice I'm providing the same input. Basically, my name is Jules White and I'm
teaching a course on prompt engineering. But the program that pro that ChatGPT is
using to produce the output is changing. I've changed the rules over and over. Now you can imagine talking to a personal
assistant and you can say okay, I want you to do X and they do it and
then you realize, wait, they didn't. There's something else I want and you give
them an additional rule to follow and then you tell, okay, I want you to do X
and they go and do it and they do better, but you realize that it's
not quite what I want. And so you go give them
an additional rule to follow. And when you're doing that, you're
basically building up a program for them, they're building up a set of instructions
that they need to follow whenever you give them this particular task. And that's what we are doing with ChatGPT. We are programming and so
we're using the same input over and over, my name is Jules White and I'm
teaching a course on prompt engineering. We're using it here, but each time
the output that we're getting is getting different and more complex because we're
asking ChatGPT to do different things. We're giving it more instructions for
the program and the final result is now
we've got structured output. It's got additional examples, all of this has come from what
we've asked ChatGPT to go and do.
