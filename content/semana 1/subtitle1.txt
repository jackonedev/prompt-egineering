I want you to think
of ChatGPT and these large language
models as tools that you can use to give
your ideas form, to give your thoughts,
realization. To be able to explore lots of different concepts and be able to refine them over
interactions with the tool. I don't want you to think
of these tools as something that you use to just write essays or answer
questions that's really missing the capabilities
of the tools. These are tools that
really allow you to do fascinating things. Now I'm going to try to give
you an example of this. To hopefully motivate you that these tools have immense
capabilities and that those capabilities
can allow you to do things that would be very
difficult to do otherwise. What does a task that I
thought of that would be something that we
can all relate to. I thought about my family and I thought about
this crazy idea. We have this great
restaurant from Uzbekistan, that's in Nashville. We have a great
restaurant from Ethiopia. We've actually got lots of
great Ethiopian restaurants. I thought to myself, what
would it look like to create a meal plan that was
based on a fusion of cuisine from Uzbekistan
and Ethiopia. What would that look
like in the past, I've eaten keto, So could
we try to make a keto? Because I still like
to limit my carbs. At the end of the day, realistically, I'm going to have to buy all the
ingredients for this, and they're not easily accessible at the grocery
store down the street from me, I'm probably not going
to cook the meals. I thought, well,
let's go to ChatGPT and see if it can help
us with this problem, if it can help us prototype what this meal plan
might look like. I went to ChatGPT and I said, please create a meal plan
for my family that is based on a fusion of food from
Ethiopia and Uzbekistan. I want to eat keto and up
to 2000 calories per day. Pick dishes where
the ingredients are easy to get from an
average US grocery store. Now this is a hard problem. I don't think that
there's a human on the planet that can easily
answer this question. If they are, I probably
could not find them. It would probably cost me
too much to hire them, and they certainly
couldn't do this as fast as I'm about to
get it done for me. I asked ChatGPT had to do this
for me, and ChatGPT says, here's a sample meal-plan that combines flavors
from Ethiopia and Uzbekistan while also being keto friendly and within a 2000
calorie per day limit, breakfast scrambled eggs
with sauteed onions, tomatoes, and Ethiopian
berbere spice. Now notice what it does. It puts in parentheses, it says made with chili powder, paprika, garlic powder,
ginger, cumin, and coriander. Now what its signaling is, berbere spice is
something you can get at the average
US grocery store. All of these spices
are easy to obtain from a normal US grocery store. Not only is it
answering my question, it's giving me an
Ethiopian breakfast dish. It's giving me information
that I'm going to be able to get these spices. Now, I don't know enough about Ethiopian cuisine
to know if this is a really accurate dish. It may not be, it may be inspired by it
and very Americanized. But I'm still for me and what I'm trying to do this
is pretty impressive. Then goes on to say lunch, Uzbek style lamb kebabs
with grilled vegetables, bell peppers,
zucchini, eggplant, and aside of cucumber and tomato salad dressed with
olive oil and lemon juice. Now you notice all of this
is pretty keto friendly too. Now some people could take
issue with the onions, but it's a really
good first start of giving this crazy
idea I have form. Now, it may have errors in it, it may not be perfect, but I could go and
work with this and refine it and start
improving it. That's one of the
things I want you to think about throughout
this course is, don't think of
this as a one-off. I give it a question. I look at the answer and I say
it's good or bad, no. I went back to it
and I thought, well, one of the things that I'm
really missing from this is I don't know how much to eat. I said, Can you give me an
approximate serving size for myself for each dish that is within my
2000 calorie limit. ChatGPT says sure here
are approximate serving sizes for each dish based on a 2000 calorie per day limit. Breakfast scrambled eggs
with sauteed onions, tomatoes and Ethiopian
berbere spice mix. Then it hasn't
parentheses two eggs, half a cup of onions,
half a cup of tomatoes, one teaspoon of berbere
spice mix served with a side of sliced avocado,
1/4 medium avocado. It goes on to give
me now serving sizes for each of these
different dishes. Now, again, I didn't go
and I didn't take it into some calorie
calculator and look at the macros and check if
it really fit my diet. Because I was just fascinated about prototyping this idea, exploring this concept and
I could keep refining it. I could keep looking
and improving it, asking it to break down things
really an analyzing and making sure it exactly
fits what I'm looking for. But instead I want to
do something different. I'm going to go and continue this thread
of conversation, this crazy idea that I had and give it a
little more form. What I thought about is
if I was really going to take this crazy idea
into my family, I'd have to think about
my nine-year-old son. My wife and I are more
adventurous eaters. But my nine-year-old, he's not always going to want to eat everything that
we come up with. I thought, well, what
can I do to help him get excited about
trying these things out? I thought I can go back to ChatGPT and I try to get
ChatGPT's help with this. I said ChatGPT, my son is nine, sometimes he won't
try new dishes. To make this culinary
adventure more fun for him, can you create a short Pokemon battle story
to go with each dish? If you're not familiar
with Pokemon, it's trading cards in a game and a cartoon my son loves it. I will read the stories
with him before dinner to get him excited
about trying the new food. Make sure the story ends with a cliff-hanger that will motivate him to
try the new food. Now maybe I could find somebody who could give me
a meal plan based on Uzbek cuisine and
Ethiopian cuisine, but make it Quito and do all
those things and look it up. I'm not sure they could do
it anywhere near as fast. But now we're really moving into territory where it's
going to be hard to find a single human
being and to get somebody to do all of this
is going to be expensive. I'm doing this in a
matter of minutes. What is ChatGPT say? Certainly. Here are some
short Pokemon battle stories to go with each dish. Then we had the breakfast
dish with the Berbere spice. It says story, Pikachu and his friends were exploring the wilds
of Ethiopia and they were suddenly
ambushed by a group of sneaky Pokemon thieves. It goes on to have this Burberry dragon
that they're battling. Then it says in the end,
they emerge victorious, but not before the dragon
left a fiery spice that imbued their breakfast
eggs with a flavorful kick. Can you help Pikachu
and his friends defeat the Berbere dragon and
enjoy this spicy breakfast? That's pretty amazing. We've gone from a meal plan to now help my son get
excited about eating this by mixing in some
concept that he's really excited about and it's actually
produced a cliff-hanger. Is this the best cliff-hanger? Maybe, maybe not.
But does it matter? No, because I'm rapidly
experimenting with my ideas. I'm trying to get
my thought form. I'm trying to
understand what this would look like and I could go and I could refine it
and improve it further, but it's already done
a pretty good job. I could probably take
this and read it to my son and have him more
excited about trying the dish. Then I thought, well, let's
take this crazy idea further. We're going to be sitting
at the dinner table. We're going to read
these crazy stories that ChatGPT has generated for me to try to get my son excited about eating
these dishes. I thought what else do we do at the dinner table that I
could weave into this? I thought, well, one of the
things we do is we talk about what my son is
learning at school. One of the things he loves is learning math and
play in math games. I thought, well, is there
a way I can integrate that into this whole crazy idea? I said, ChatGPT I
would like you to play a math game with my
nine-year-old to teach him about division with
fractions and nutrition. Ask him questions one at a time involving Pokemon
in these topics and make it into a game when
he wins the Pokemon win, ask the first question. ChatGPT says, great, let's play a fun math game involving Pokemon and nutrition. Question 1, Pikachu
and his friends are planning a meal that includes
half a cup of cooked rice, but they need to divide it
evenly among three Pokemon. How much rice will
each Pokemon get? It gives them a hint. It says, if you get stuck, feel free to ask me for more hints for guidance
and what does it do? It then waits for
my son to respond. We go and we type in the answer. We type in one-sixth. Now notice, before we
were asking it questions, and now it's asked
us a question. We've told it to
create this math game. It's now asked me or
my son a question. I'm typing in one-sixth
as the answer. Now ChatGPT says, good
job, that's correct. Each Pokemon will get one-sixth
a cup of cooked rice. We got this answer by
dividing one-half by three, which gives us, and it
works out the math for us. We went from this crazy idea of a meal plan
that's based on food from his Pakistan and Ethiopia. That's keto-friendly
that I can get it at average grocery store with an added serving sizes
or portions to it. We then took that and
we got it to generate Pokemon battle stories with cliff-hanger that would help my son get excited about
eating these dishes. Then I created a game, a math game based
on nutrition and Pokemon to go along with this
to make it even more fun. Then I thought, Well,
what else can we do this? I mean, let's really give this thought some
form at the end. We've gotten the meal plan, we've gotten the stories, we've got this game. Can we give the game real form? I use some of my
domain knowledge as computer scientists to say, Let's create code for this. We're actually going to
produce software for it. I said let's create code
for this in Python, but I want it to be a web application
and I'm not going to go through all the details because they are
domain-specific. They use my knowledge
of computer science. But the key thing is, is that ChatGPT then
generates actual software, the code for software for this, I'm not going through all of it, but the important piece of it is when we get to the end of it, we actually have real working
software that I can run on a computer to play this
math game with my son. You can see that we took
some simple idea and we rapidly prototyped it
into all different forms. At any point in time, we could go and we could further refine one of the
forms so we can take the meal plan that didn't
have information about how much to eat and portions and we could add that into it. We could reshape it into a
completely different form. We could then eventually
get to the end and take some form that
we had created and take it out of the language model and
turn it into software. That capability of taking our ideas and rapidly iterating and
prototyping with them, that's just one example of
the type of thing that we can do with these large language
modules like ChatGPT. Now, I hope this example
helps to get you inspired about the capabilities of what you're going to learn
to do within this course.
