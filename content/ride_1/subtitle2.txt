Welcome to this course
on prompt engineering. I'm Jules White and I'll be guiding you
through this exploration of an absolutely fascinating topic that I'm really
excited to talk to you about. I'm an associate professor in
computer science at Vanderbilt and I'm the associate dean of
strategic learning programs and Vanderbilt School of Engineering. I'm going to talk to you about this really
fascinating and timely and important topic for all of us, which is how do we interact
with large language models like ChatGPT. Now I really hope that this course
inspires you to start using large language models like ChatGPT, and we'll talk about
what large language of models are in more detail in this course, but you can
sort of use it interchangeably until we talk about it as ChatGP T
is a large language model. Now we've seen a lot of back and
forth and discussion in the news about what are these tools, and
what we've really seen them presented as in some respects as tools for
cheating on exams or writing essays. We've seen them presented as tools for
plagiarism or tools that are going to
take over the world. And I really want to reshape your
discussion of these tools and make you see that they're also, and
I primarily from my perspective, a new tool to really help
unlock human creativity, to allow you to do things
that you couldn't do before, to actually take your thoughts and
give them form and do it really rapidly. These are tools that allow me to do things
faster and better than I could before. Now I came into computer science. I actually started from visual art. I went into East Asian studies for a while
and then I ended up being a computer scientist, but I've always really
had a passion for creativity and understanding how I could use different
mediums and be it paint or ceramics or code to do interesting things. And I look at large language models
as sort of a new fundamental medium. I can use it for programming, but
I can also use it to create art. I can use it to improve my writing. I can use it to help perform
thought experiments. There's so many interesting uses for these
large language models like ChatGPT and we're not properly seeing them discussed. And so what this course is really about
is it's teaching you how to leverage all of these interesting
capabilities of these models. But in order to leverage these
capabilities, in order to go and do the really creative things, you have
to understand how you write prompts, and that's what this class is about,
it's how you interact with Chat GPT or another large language model. A prompt is what you write and
give to ChatGPT or another one of these models
to get some type of output. But these are fundamentally really
exciting tools that I think expand the capabilities that we have as humans,
to express ourselves, to explore new ideas and to create, realizations
of our ideas faster than ever before. Now let's get started on this course, I've actually enlisted ChatGPT's
help to welcome us to the course. Tell us a little bit about
what we're going to learn. ChatGPT says welcome to
the course on prompt engineering. In this course, you will learn about
the exciting field of prompt engineering, which is all about creating prompts that
can program large language models to produce high quality outputs. Now don't worry,
we'll talk a little bit about this. Do you need to be a programmer? We'll ask ChatGPT In a second. We will explore the different types
of prompts, their patterns and techniques for refining and
improving them. You will also learn how to use large
language models for various tasks such as knowledge exploration, prototyping,
content production, and assessment. By the end of the course, you will
have a better understanding of how to effectively use large
language models and their potential to shape
the future of computing. Let's get started. Well, my first question that comes up out
of this is I want to make sure that I don't have to be a programmer
to benefit from this course. Do I need to understand
programming to take this course? No, you do not need to have any
programming experience to take this course. The focus of this course is on
creating effective prompts and using large language models to
achieve your desire to output. While an understanding of program could be
helpful, it is not necessary to understand the concepts and techniques we
will be covering in this course. What other things might be helpful to me to know before taking this course? While programming experience is not
necessary, it would be helpful if you have some familiarity with basic computer
concepts such as file management, opening and saving files and
using a command line interface. Now by command line interface,
we need something like ChatGPT. >> Additionally, having good writing
skills and the ability to think creatively will be important in generating effective
prompts for large language models. Finally, being open to exploring new and
evolving technologies and approaches will be key to getting
the most out of this course. So there's really not a lot you need to
know as ChatGPT has aptly said right here, you need some basic understanding
of computer concepts. You need to be able to open up ChatGPT,
it calls it a terminal, but you can think of it as you need to be able
to open up ChatGPT and interact with it. Obviously, if you can't use a tool for
this, you're going to have
a hard time opening files. But the fact that you're here probably
means you have the right computer skills to do this. The second piece is something
I want to talk about. Now we think of these models as something
that came out of computer science, but they're actually things that having
experience writing, being able to think about writing clearly and effectively
is actually really helpful in this. My father was a professor of creative
writing and it's been really interesting to me because this is helpful
to me when I'm working with these tools is to think about what I learned from him and
how I design the prompts. And finally, I want to emphasize
this last point, creativity and an openness to exploration is really,
really important with these tools. The creativity of the human that's
putting in the words for the prompts, who's deciding what goes into that
prompt in the organization and what gets asked and what instructions
are given are fundamentally important for using these tools effectively. Now we've heard a lot about these tools
is like they are plagiarism tools, they are tools to do X,
Y, and Z bad thing. But the truth is, if you really want to
use them effectively, you have to be skilled, you have to be a creative
thinker, a creative problem solver. The more creative you are,
the better the outputs are going to be. You also need an openness to explore. You have to remember,
this is very early days for these tools, we haven't developed the best practices
in all the different domains for how we're going to use these tools, for
how we're going to write prompts, for every domain from health care to customer
service to creative writing, whatever the domain is, we're still figuring
out how to write the best prompts. And so having an openness to go and
explore and try out different things
is really important. In fact, when you're programming with
these tools or working with these tools, and don't get scared
because I said programming, because you'll see that you
can program with these tools. Anybody can just by writing
normal human language. But when you're working with these tools,
often you need to go and try out different things. You need to try something and then be open
to trying a different variation on it and seeing what happens, running little
experiments a lot of times in life, it takes so much effort to write
something or to generate some program, some software, or whatever it is that
we're trying to do that we don't get to explore as much as we should. We don't get to think enough about design. We don't get to think enough about the big
ideas, the problems we're trying to solve. And one of the things that's good is an
openness to explore in using these tools. So what are some of the key concepts that we will learn in the course that will help us with problem solving? In this course, we will learn several concepts that
can help with problems solving. Understanding what prompts are and how to
use them to program large language models to generate high quality outputs, learning
how to create effective prompts by tapping the patterns from training data,
being specific with our inputs and using patterns such as the persona pattern
question refinement and cognitive verifie. Understanding how to refine prompts and
use techniques such as rewriting, combining splitting, and expanding to
achieve the desired output, learning how to use large language models for various
tasks such as knowledge exploration, prototyping, content production,
assessment, and more. Understanding how to use few shot examples
to teach large language models new tasks and how to format these examples
properly to achieve the desired output. By learning and applying these concepts, we can effectively use large language
models to solve problems and generate high quality outputs across
a wide range of applications. So I hope that as we go through this
course that you will become inspired to take the ideas that you're learning,
to go into ChatGPT or whatever tool is available to you and
to try them out to explore the things that you're passionate about, and to see ways
that you can unlock your own creativity, that you can give yourself more time for
high level thinking and problem solving as opposed to being down in the details
of how you give your thought form. So throughout this course, one of
the themes you'll hear from me is try to give your thought
form through this tool, use it as a tool to accelerate
your ideas into realization. So I look forward to exploring
this fascinating concept with you, this fascinating topic
of prompt engineering.
