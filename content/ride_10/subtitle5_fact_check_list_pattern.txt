We've heard over and
over in the news that these large bank language models make all kinds of mistakes and can lie to you and
they'll never admit their mistakes in
the first place nail to keep telling
you they're right and produce weird outputs. Of course, this fundamentally misses the point of the tool. These aren't meant to be tools for answering
questions necessarily. Now sometimes they can answer questions and do it
very accurately. Sometimes they produce things
that look like answers but aren't actually accurate. As long as we understand
they're really for generating text and sometimes the texts they
generate can answer things for us correctly and sometimes it's going to make mistakes. As long as we realized that we can use these tools effectively. Now one thing we can
do is we can use prompts to support us
in our identification of what are the facts that the tool is putting into
its output and which of those facts really matter and we can go in then follow
up on them and check them. Now one of the
things that happens sometimes when we're working with output from these tools, is that because the output
looks so realistic, so humans so convincing, we assume that it's
true and when it's producing large volumes of text, it can be hard to spot all the different assumptions
and facts that are baked into the text that we really need to follow
up on and back check. Anything you get out of one of these models you need
to take ownership of and make sure that you've checked it thoroughly
and really believe it. What do we do to support
us in this effort of trying to make sure the output
is correct and factual. Well, we can use
the fact checklist pattern to help us figure out what facts are actually in the output and need
to be followed up on. I'm going to give you
an example of this. I've taken our outline
expansion tool. If you remember, we used a
couple of different patterns, including the menu
actions pattern, we use the outline
expansion pattern. We had several
different capabilities. One of the things we
could do is we could go and expand the outline. We also added the ability
to be able to generate texts for any bullet
in the outline, so and we can generate for
a number of items and we had a whole menu system
to be able to do this. Now one of the things we'd
like to be able to do is when we do generate texts
for part of the outline, I'd like to know what I need to follow up on
and fact check at that point in order to
make sure that I don't present information
that's inaccurate. If we look at this, the way that we can
do this as with the fact pack check
list pattern. We say, whenever
you output text, generate a set of facts that
are contained in the output. The set of facts
should be inserted at the end of the output and you can put them wherever you want. I'm just putting
them at the end. The set of facts should be
fundamental facts that can undermine the veracity of the output if any of
them are correct. I'm setting up a new set of instructions for the large
language model that says, anytime you produce text, give me the corresponding set of facts that the texts depends on. That's the way I can go and
follow up on them and check them and so it says
that understands. Now I'm going to use our outline expansion
program that we've written them and tell it
to write a paragraph for Section 3.5.2.2. This section is
considerations for choosing the appropriate style and it generates a whole
paragraph of text for me. Then what it does is
it generates a set of fundamental facts down here
that are the facts that are contained within
the paragraph and so the facts are for example writing
style can range from technical to creative
to instructional. There are other things
like instructional content may adopt a clear and
step by step style. Now this paragraph that
I chose for it to write, it has a lot of different facts that maybe they're correct,
maybe they're not, but it's not something that
I have to worry as much about going in extracting
and just staring a text because I now have a list of things
to follow up on. At a minimum, I need to look at this list and follow up on these items or just actually visually check them myself
for my own knowledge, that's the minimum level. Now I have a minimum bar, at least these things
I need to go and follow up on and
it's flagging to me, here are some things that
you need to go and check. The other thing I can
do is I can compare this list to the
paragraph up here. Any person that's probably using one of these
tools can compare. Here's the list of facts below. Here's the actual text above is the list
of facts complete, are there statements in
the text above that are missing below and if there are, those are probably
things that I would want to go and follow
up on as well. By checking and
comparing the two lists, one we can see is it really fully extracting all
of the facts that are important and that
in itself will clue us into and make us think through what is this really saying and what are
the fundamental facts to it. Just the action of going and comparing the
facts to the text it's produced will help
us get us into the mode of thinking through the correctness
of what is produced. The next thing I can do
is I have a minimum bar, at least I need to go and
check up at the very minimum, I need to go and check
the list of facts that it produced and follow up and make sure that
they are correct. If any of them is incorrect, then probably there's an
error in the text above. Then if I notice that there's
something in the text above through this
comparison that's also not present in the facts, I could add that to my
list and go check it. This is a tool that
can help us get into the mode of fact
checking the output. It may be correct, but we still don't know for sure until we actually
fully follow up on it. This gives us some
tools to help us one know that there are
things to follow up on, at least follow up
on these things, and then two, to help us give us a tool that we can
go and compare to what it produced to see is the minimum list of things that I followed up
and good enough. Or they're all other things that are in that
text that maybe I should think through
or follow up on. Now, it doesn't guarantee
that we're going to come up with the right answer. We might think that it's
still accurate when it's not, even if we follow
up on those facts, there may be some
hidden assumptions but it's much better
than if we just read a bunch of text with no support or stimulus to think through
the fact checking process. The fact checklist pattern is something that helps
us get us into the mode of checking the
output, checking its veracity, and having a format
that makes it easier for us to extract and compare the information
and the such a facts with what's really true using
other external sources.
